Building a web app that analyzes bike share data

This web app will solve questions such as 
1. Data Visuals: Display or graph 3 metrics or trends from the data set that are interesting to you.
2. Which start/stop stations are most popular?
3. What is the average distance traveled?
4. How many riders include bike sharing as a regular part of their commute?
5. How does ridership change with seasons? Types of passes used, trip duration, etc
6. Is there a net change of bikes over the course of a day? If so, when and where should bikes be transported in order to make sure bikes match travel patterns?
7. What is the breakdown of Trip Route Category-Passholder type combinations? What might make a particular combination more popular?

To see the web app in action, open a new tab and type in davidterpay.github.io

This web app is my submission for the Capital One Summit Challenge.
