## MindSumo challenge
Bike shares are becoming increasingly common in cities in the United States. Commuters have been using bike sharing as a method of transportation for the flexibility, cost savings, exercise, and a myriad of other benefits. While being quite successful, many bike shares are still relatively new and have room for optimization.

We want you to build a web app that analyzes and visualizes bike share data from the city of Los Angeles.
