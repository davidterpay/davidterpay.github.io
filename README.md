## MindSumo challenge
Bike shares are becoming increasingly common in cities in the United States. Commuters have been using bike sharing as a method of transportation for the flexibility, cost savings, exercise, and a myriad of other benefits. While being quite successful, many bike shares are still relatively new and have room for optimization.

We want you to build a web app that analyzes and visualizes bike share data from the city of Los Angeles.

1. Data Visuals: Display or graph 3 metrics or trends from the data set that are interesting to you.

2. Which start/stop stations are most popular?

3. What is the average distance traveled?

4. How many riders include bike sharing as a regular part of their commute?
(Optional) Bonus features you may want to include to stand out:

5. How does ridership change with seasons? Types of passes used, trip duration, etc

6. Is there a net change of bikes over the course of a day? If so, when and
where should bikes be transported in order to make sure bikes match travel patterns?

7. What is the breakdown of Trip Route Category-Passholder type combinations? What might make a particular combination more popular?
