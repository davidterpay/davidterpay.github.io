            <h1>One Way Trip to the Moon</h1>
            <p>Using both one way and round trips from our data, bikers rode nearly 250000 miles. Enough milage to travel the globe
            10 times. Enough milage to have 110 people bike the Tour de France. 
            </p>
            <p>Since one way trips are more accurate (don't require an estimate), this route trip category had enough milage to travel the
            globe nearly 5 and a half times.

            <h1>$800,000 dollars Saved</h1>
            <p>Average gas prices in L.A during this time period were 3.29 (FRED data), this means that bikers saved nearly 800,000 dollars. This cost excludes
                the amount of time saved and the cost of staying in one of the world's most notorious traffic cities.
            </p>
            <p>
                 If only one way trips are considered, bikers saved nearly 430,000 dollars.

            <h1>196,100 Pounds of CO2 Emmision Reduced</h1>
            <p>Burning one gallon of gas creates 20 pounds of carbon dioxide. According to the EPA, average MPG of a car in the U.S is 24.7
            MPG. This means that bikers prevented over 196,100 pounds of CO2 emmision. While biking helped reduce pollution, biking more
            also helped users get a good workout. If we assume that biking on average consumes around 38 calories, clients burned 9,202,978
            total calories.  </p>

            <h1>Average Distance Traveled</h1>
            <p>The aggregate average distance traveled is 1.82 miles on 131472 total trips; average distance on one way
            trips is 1.10 miles in 118690 trips; average distance on round trips is 8.7 miles in 12782 trips.
            </p>
            <p>To calculate the distance traveled in one way trips, the Distance Matrix API from Google Map's was used. This API estimates
            the amount of time the path requires, the total distance, and directions. The distance traveled in one way trips
            amounted to 130690.67 miles. Since round-trips have the same start/end station, it is important to understand how people
            bike in urban cities. A conclusive study in Copenhagen determined that the average biking speed in a urban city was 9.6 mph.
            From this estimate, 9.6 mph * 11614 total hours on round trips amounts to 111492.959 miles.

            <h1>Popular Start/End Stations</h1>
            <p>From looking at the bar chart of total bike usage per hour, we can see that the most frequently used hour is 6 pm. This
                is during rush hour in L.A. It makes sense that total demand for a bike increases dramatically during that time period
                because people are trying to get home as fast as possible. If we assume that most monthly commuters are monthly pass
                holders, we can see a different bar chart. There are spikes at 9 am, 1 pm and 6 pm. This can be account for in mornign
                rush hour, lunch, and rush hour back home. In the morning, it would be smart to allocate many bikes in the station
                (34.063179, -118.24588); during lunch break, it would be smart to allocate many bikes in the station (34.04681, -118.24353);
                finnaly, during rush hour post work it would be smart to allocate many bikes to the station (34.04855, -118.25904799999999).</p>

            <p>Considering that monthy pass holders are very likely to be commuters, we can take the average of the daily bike usage monday

            <h1>Breakdown of Trip Route Category-Passholder Type Combinations</h1>
            <p>From this we can see that monthly users are much more likely to take one way trips (77099.0 vs. 3765.0). This only
                confirms that monthly users are likely commuters. Walk up users still use one way trips far more than round trips
                (32322.0 vs. 8446.0). Flex users are also more likely to use one way trips with 8981.0 vs. 483.0. Finally, staff
                are also more likely to be one way users with 286.0 vs. 80.0.</p>
