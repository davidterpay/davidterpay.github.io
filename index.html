            <h1>One Way Trip to the Moon</h1>
            <p>Using both one-way and round trips from the data, bikers rode nearly 250,000 miles. Enough milage to circle the
                globe 10 times. Enough milage to have 110 people bike the Tour de France. Enough milage to bike 3/4's of
                the total miles of roads in the state of California.

            <h1>$800,000 dollars Saved</h1>
            <p>According to FRED data, The average gas price in L.A during this stretch of time was $3.29. According to the
                EPA, the average MPG of a car in the U.S is 24.7 MPG. This cost excludes the implicit cost of commuting via
                bike instead of car or transit. Considering that Los Angeles is notoriously known as one of the most traffic
                condensed cities, the opportunity cost of riding a bike rather than commuting on transit or car is very likely
                to be far lower. Therefore, if we were to estimate the true economic cost, bike share users would have saved
                millions.

            <h1>196,100 Pounds of CO2 Emmision Reduced</h1>
            <p>According to the EPA, burning one gallon of gas creates 20 pounds of carbon dioxide. As mentioned before, the
                average MPG of a car in the U.S is 24.7 MPG. This means that bikers prevented over 196,100 pounds of CO2
                emmisions. While biking reduced pollution, biking alo helped clients get a good workout. If we assume that biking
                for one mile on average consumes 38 calories, all clients combined burned a total of 9,202,978 calories.

            <h1>Popular Starting Stations</h1>
            <p>
                We can seperate each day into three segments - morning, lunch, and rush hour - and determine the most popular start and end
                locations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most popular starting station in the mornings is at 668 N Figueroa St, Los Angeles, CA (34.063179, -118.24588) right
                outside of Chinatown. This bike station is known as Figueroa & Cesar Chavez.
            </p>

            <p>
                During the conventional lunch break (12 pm - 2 pm), it would be smart to allocate many bikes in the station 350 E Third Street,
                Los Angeles, CA 90013 (34.04681, -118.24353). This station is called 3rd & San Pedro.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, during rush hour post work it would be smart to allocate many bikes to the station at 723 S Flower Street, Los Angeles,
                CA 90017 (34.04855, -118.25904799999999). This station is called 7th & Flower.

            <h1>Popular Ending Stations</h1>
            <p>
                If we follow the same format as finding the most popular starting stations we get the following.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most popular ending station in the mornings is at 723 S Flower Street, Los Angeles, CA 90017 (34.063179, -118.25904799999999).
                This station is called 7th & Flower. This is the same location as the most popular starting location in the
                evening. This implies that several people commute to here in the mornings and from here in the evenings.
            </p>

            <p>
                During the conventional lunch break (12 pm - 2 pm), the most popular ending statoin at 350 E Third Street, Los Angeles, CA
                90013 (34.04681, -118.24353). This station is called 3rd & San Pedro. This is the same location as the most
                popular starting location for lunch time. This means that several people take advantage to bike from their
                work, which is neear 3rd and San Pedro, to eat somewhere and then return back.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, during rush hour (post work) the most popular ending station is at 532 W Olive Street (34.04855, -118.25904799999999).
                This station is called Olive & 5th.

            <h1>Average Distance Traveled</h1>
            <p>The aggregate average distance traveled is 1.82 miles on 131472 total trips; average distance on one way trips
                is 1.10 miles in 118690 trips; average distance on round trips is 8.7 miles in 12782 trips.
            </p>
            <p>To calculate the distance traveled in one way trips, the Distance Matrix API from Google Map's was used. This
                API estimates the amount of time the path requires, the total distance, and directions. The distance traveled
                in one way trips amounted to 130690.67 miles. Since round-trips have the same start/end station, it is important
                to understand how people bike in urban cities. A conclusive study in Copenhagen determined that the average
                biking speed in a urban city was 9.6 mph. From this estimate, 9.6 mph * 11614 total hours on round trips
                amounts to 111492.959 miles.

            <h1>Commuters</h1>
            <p>The graph Bike Share Usage Since 07/07/2016 displays the total number of bikes used by each type of pass holder. T represents
            total. F represents flex pass holders. M represents monthly pass holders. W represents walk ups, and S represents Staff.
            From this graph we can deduce that monthly pass holders and walk ups make up the biggest demographic group in total bike share
            users and in total cyclical demand of bikes. As the number of bikes used by monthly users spikes, the number of walk ups
            jumps down and vice versa. This can further lead to the conclusion that there is an inverse relationship between the two
            groups. After further analyzing the data, it is clear that monthly users are commuters because their total usage is highest
            during the work week (Monday - Friday). On the other hand, walk ups are much more frequent during the weekends meaning that
            walk ups are very likely to be recreational users.
            </p>
            <p>
                 According to the boxplot of Bike Share Usage among Monthly Pass Holders, the median of total daily bike usage by monthly
                users is 300 bikes. If we deduct the fact that these pass holders have to commute to and from work, we get a total of around
                150 clients. If we include the total amount of flex pass holders and staff, we can total our number of daily commuters to
                around 180 clients.
            </p>

            <h1>Net Change of Bikes Over the Course of a Day</h1>
            <p>According to the bar chart of Total Bike Usage Per Hour, the most frequent time for bike usage is 6 pm. This is during rush hour
            in L.A. Total demand for a bike increases dramatically during that time period because people are trying to get home as fast
            as possible. If we assume that most commuters are monthly pass holders, a different bar chart appears. According to Bike
            Usage by Hour (Monthly Users), there are spikes at 9 am, 1 pm and 6 pm. This can be accounted for in morning rush hour, lunch,
            and evening rush hour. As mentioned in the paragraph describing popular start/end stations, in order to allocate bikes efficiently
            it is important to understand the trends seen during the weekday. In short, in order to maximize allocative efficiency, bikes
            should be placed in the most popular starting stations for each segement of the day - morning, lunch, and evening rush hour.
            As mentioned before, these stations would be on Figueroa & Cesar Chavez in the morning, 3rd & San Pedro during lunch, and
            7th & Flower for the evening.

            <h1>Trip Route Category vs. Passholder Type Combinations</h1>
            <p>After grouping together trips that have common passholder type, the following conclusions can be made. Monthly users are
            much more likely to take one way trips - 77099 one way trips vs. 3765.0 round trips. This furthers the argument that monthly
            users are commuters. Walk up users use one way trips far more often than round trips - 32322 one way trips vs. 8446 trips.
            Flex users are also more likely to use one way trips - 8981 one way trips vs. 483 round trips. Finally, staff are also more
            likely to be one way users - 286.0 one way trips vs. 80.0 round trips. Since one way trips are far more popular overall,
            Metro Bike Share could give discounts to those who want to make round trips so that profitablility in that route category
            can increase. As the demand increases, the amount of revenue generated will outweigh the total discounted price.</p>

            <h1>Seasonality</h1>
            <p>The most consistent and cyclical data comes from monthly clients and walk up clients. This can be in part explained by the
            fact that monthly users are more than likely to be commuters. The cyclicality can be explained by the work week. During the
            days monday-friday, many people are using bikes but this demand drops significantly during the weekends. On the other end
            of things, we can see that when the weekends come by, the number of walk-ups increases substaintially. This implies that
            monthly users are commuters (as mentioned), and walk-ups are people primarly recreational users. There are two very interesting
            spikes in usage from the our time series data. These dates are 2016-10-16 with 1477 bikes used and 2017-01-21 with 746. 2016-10-16
            was national world food day and the L.A Dodgers were playing the Chicago Cubs in the second game of the NLCS; on 2017-01-21
            there was a women's march in Los Angles. As the weather got cooler in L.A, demand for bikes declined. Consumer tastes are
            driven in line with the period of the season (which is related to the time of year). In addition, as winter break came along
            - weeks between December 15 and January 15 - demand for bikes is at its lowest. This logistically makes sense because less
            people are coming to work and more are vacationing. The peak for our data set was in the months of July - August. Factors that
            can explain why this is peak include the weather, the fact that people are vacationing less, and those months are particularly busy 
            (internships and general work).
