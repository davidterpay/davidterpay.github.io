            <h1>One Way Trip to the Moon</h1>
            <p>Using both one way and round trips from our data, bikers drove nearly 250000 miles. Enough milage to travel the globe nearly 10 times. 
                Enough milage to have 110 people bike the entirity of the Tour de France. Distance was calculated by seperating one - way trips and
                round trips. Distance in one - way trips was calculated using Google's Distance Matrix API, accumlating a total of 130690.67 miles. 
                Using an average biking speed of 9.6 mph (taken from average biking speed in Copenhagen) and the total duration of round trips, we get 
                9.6 mph * 11614 hours = 111492.959 miles.

            <p>Average gas prices in L.A during this time period were 3.29 (FRED data), this means that bikers saved nearly 800,000 dollars. This cost excludes
                the amount of time saved and the cost of staying in one of the world's most notorious traffic cities.

            <h1>196,100 Pounds of CO2 Emmision Reduced</h1>
            <p>Burning one gallon of gas creates 20 pounds of carbon dioxide. According to the EPA, average MPG of a car in the U.S is 24.7
            MPG. This means that bikers prevented over 196,100 pounds of CO2 emmision. While biking  helped reduce pollution, biking more also helped users get a good workout. If we assume that biking on average consumes around 38
        calories, clients burned 9,202,978 total calories.  </p>

            <h1>Average Distance Traveled</h1>
            <p>Using Google Maps API's, the total distance traveled in one-way trips amounted to over 130690.67 miles. The Distance Matrix API inputs 
                start/end coordinates and calculates various heuristics on the path a client would take. This includes an estimate on the amount of
                time the path requires which traffic conditions, the total distance, and directions. Since round-trips have the same start/end station, it was
                important to understand how people bike in urban cities. A conclusive study in Copenhagen determined that the average biking speed was 9.6 mph.
                trips. we get 9.6 mph * 11614 total hours on round trips amounts to 111492.959 miles. Note this data excludes trips where the bike was not returned.
                In other words, the destination station ID was either 3000 or the destination longitude/latuitude was NaN. Otherwise our data would be dramatically
                skewed to the right.

            <h1>Popular Start/End Stations</h1>
            <p>From looking at the bar chart of total bike usage per hour, we can see that the most frequently used hour is 6 pm. This
                is during rush hour in L.A. It makes sense that total demand for a bike increases dramatically during that time period
                because people are trying to get home as fast as possible. If we assume that most monthly commuters are monthly pass
                holders, we can see a different bar chart. There are spikes at 9 am, 1 pm and 6 pm. This can be account for in mornign
                rush hour, lunch, and rush hour back home. In the morning, it would be smart to allocate many bikes in the station
                (34.063179, -118.24588); during lunch break, it would be smart to allocate many bikes in the station (34.04681, -118.24353);
                finnaly, during rush hour post work it would be smart to allocate many bikes to the station (34.04855, -118.25904799999999).</p>

            <h1>Breakdown of Trip Route Category-Passholder Type Combinations</h1>
            <p>From this we can see that monthly users are much more likely to take one way trips (77099.0 vs. 3765.0). This only
                confirms that monthly users are likely commuters. Walk up users still use one way trips far more than round trips
                (32322.0 vs. 8446.0). Flex users are also more likely to use one way trips with 8981.0 vs. 483.0. Finally, staff
                are also more likely to be one way users with 286.0 vs. 80.0.</p>
